# tick_box_detector
Designed to read in multiple images and return a specific value, which corresponds to which tick box (out of three) has been marked.

Original images were of varying qualities and this did not cause too much of a problem. However the code struggles when the pictures are 
not orientated correctly, and required me to manually rotate and then overwrite original image
